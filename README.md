Agency Jekyll theme modified for photo gallery usage
====================

**Goal:** Re-purpose the Agency theme as a Photo Portfolio with a focus on model photos

Most settings have been moved into _config.yml and can be adjusted from there.


====================
ToDo still:
- [ ] add ModelMayhem support to the "social Network" options
- [ ] Clean up the gallery stuff
- [ ] build the hybrid / integrated About / Portfolio look
- [ ] trim down the modal
- [ ] lots of polish
    - [ ] Dynamic scrolling to specific galleries
    - [ ] link between models and galleries
    - [ ] make sure the galleries look good
- [ ] build real instructions / a real readme

====================

Based on the [Agency Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/y7kim/agency-jekyll-theme) which is based on the [Agency bootstrap theme ](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/)
